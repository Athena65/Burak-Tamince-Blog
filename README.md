# **Burak Tamince's Personal Blog Page**

Welcome to the personal blog page of **Burak Tamince**! This repository contains the source code for my blog, where I share my journey as a software developer, showcase my projects, and explore topics related to programming, technology, and personal growth.

## **About the Blog**
This blog serves as:
- **A Portfolio**: Highlighting my technical projects and achievements.
- **A Knowledge Hub**: Sharing insights, tutorials, and lessons I've learned in software development.
- **A Personal Space**: Documenting my growth as a developer and reflecting on my experiences.

The blog is designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind, ensuring an enjoyable experience for all visitors.

## **Tech Stack**
The blog is built using:
- **React.js**: Modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **AOS**: Animate On Scroll library for scroll animations
- **Typed.js**: JavaScript typing animation library
- **GLightbox**: Lightbox library for images and galleries
- **Isotope**: Layout library for portfolio filtering

## **Features**
- A clean and modern design for easy navigation
- Dedicated sections for portfolio projects, certificates, and videos
- Fully responsive layout, ensuring compatibility across all devices

## **Deployment**

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The workflow:

2. Deploys the build output to the `gh-pages` branch
3. GitHub Pages serves the site from the `gh-pages` branch

## **Credits & Resources**
- **Template:** The initial structure and design of this blog were inspired by the **"MyResume"** free Bootstrap template from [BootstrapMade](https://bootstrapmade.com/free-html-bootstrap-template-my-resume/). I customized and extended the template to better fit my personal brand and content needs, and converted it to React with Tailwind CSS.
